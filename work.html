	<h5>About The Great Lakes</h5>
	<p>The Great Lakes contain nearly 20 percent of the earth’s surface freshwater, providing drinking water to more than 40 million people. A 2007 Brookings Institution report determined that a healthy, restored Great Lakes could generate $50 billion in long-term economic benefits for the region. These benefits would be enjoyed by the businesses and industry that use water for commerce, as well as by beachgoers, naturalists, boaters, anglers and homeowners.</p>

			<h5>Conserving Water</h5>
			<p>Our professional staff works with scientists, government officials, businesses and everyday citizens to develop strategies for protecting our fresh water supply and eliminating wasteful water use. Chief among these is implementation of the historic Great Lakes Compact and Agreement, a first-of-its kind model that sets a high bar for new users of Great Lakes water.</p>

			<h5>Invasive Species</h5>
			<p>Invasive species foul beaches, destroy fisheries, clog water plants our economy depends on, and permanently disrupt the Great Lakes food web. Stopping invasives before they enter will save the region billions in damages and control costs, and is the only way to secure the future for a restored Great Lakes</p>
