	<h5>About The Great Lakes</h5> 
	<span class="underline"></span>
	<p class="center-align">The Great Lakes contain nearly 20 percent of the earth’s surface freshwater, providing drinking water to more than 40 million people. A 2007 Brookings Institution report determined that a healthy, restored Great Lakes could generate $50 billion in long-term economic benefits for the region. These benefits would be enjoyed by the businesses and industry that use water for commerce, as well as by beachgoers, naturalists, boaters, anglers and homeowners.</p>

	<h5>Clean Water Issues</h5>
	<span class="underline"></span>
	<p>The Alliance's Water Quality Program is dedicated to clean water that protects the health of the people, fish and wildlife of the Great Lakes by addressing:</p>
	<ul class="list">
		<li>Untreated Municipal Sewage Overflows</li>
		<li>Nutrient Runoff/Algae Growth</li>
		<li>Pollution from Petroleum Refineries and Other Industries</li> 
		<li>Pharmaceutical Pollution</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The Alliance educates people to participate in water quality decisions affecting their health, and works with government agencies, municipalities and businesses to develop strong policies and standards. We also work to ensure agencies use their authority to protect water quality, demanding agency oversight and legal enforcement when necessary.</p>

	<h5 class="margin-top">Conserving Water</h5>
	<span class="underline"></span>
	<p>Some 40 million people living in the Great Lakes drainage basin rely on the lakes for drinking water. A one-time gift from the glaciers, the Great Lakes form the largest surface freshwater system on earth; a vast but largely non-renewable resource. As the pressure on fresh water mounts around the world, the Alliance is working to ensure that these waters are maintained and protected.</p>
	<p>Before the adoption of the historic Great Lakes Compact in 2008, the Great Lakes were governed by a number of U.S.-Canadian policies aimed at protecting and stewarding these shared waters.</p>
	<p><a class="blue-link" href="http://www.greatlakes.org/Document.Doc?id=146">Annex 2001:</a> In 2001 the Great Lakes governors and Canadian premiers agreed to develop new protections that would prevent harmful water withdrawals and diversions of Great Lakes waters. The Great Lakes Charter Annex, or Annex 2001, laid the groundwork for today's historic Great Lakes Water Resources Compact.</p>

	<p><a class="blue-link" href="http://www.greatlakes.org/Document.Doc?id=149">1986 Water Resources Development Act:</a>The act gives veto power to the governors of each of the eight Great Lakes states to block any export or diversion of Great Lakes water outside the basin. Reauthorized in 2000, the act further encourages the states to work with the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec to devise and implement a “common conservation standard” for decisions about Great Lakes basin water use and withdrawals.</p>

	<p><a class="blue-link" href="http://www.greatlakes.org/Document.Doc?id=148">1985 Great Lakes Charter:</a> A non-binding, voluntary agreement through which Great Lakes states and provinces agree to cooperatively manage the waters of the Great Lakes. Among the goals: establishing programs to manage and regulate diversions and consumptive uses of Great Lakes water; and seeking agreement from one another when considering a new or increased diversion or consumptive use of 5 million gallons of water per day or more.</p>

	<p><a class="blue-link" href="http://www.greatlakes.org/Document.Doc?id=147">1909 Boundary Waters Treaty:</a> A U.S.-Canadian treaty to deal with water flow and water quality matters for all shared waters lying along or flowing across the International Boundary. The treaty established the International Joint Commission (IJC) to oversee disputes, requiring commission review and approval of diversions that would “affect the lakes' natural flow or level,” or interfere with domestic uses, boating and navigation.</p>

	<h5>Invasive Species</h5>
	<span class="underline"></span>
	<p>The Alliance released a groundbreaking report in 2008 urging a breakup of the Mississippi River and Great Lakes basins as the only way to permanently stop the devastating Asian carp and other invasives from entering the Great Lakes.</p>
	<p>The Alliance report, <a class="blue-link" href="http://http://www.greatlakes.org/Document.Doc?id=473">Preliminary Feasibility of Ecological Separation of the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes</a>, outlines six options for separating the watersheds and ending the transfer of species between them.</p>
	<p>The idea of restoring the natural physical barriers that once separated Lake Michigan and the rest of the Great Lakes from the Mississippi River continues to gain momentum.</p>
	<p>Why the worry? These fish are beyond bad. Known to batter boaters when leaping from the water, the smaller silver carp joins with the 100-plus-pound bighead carp to become the poster fish for the ecologic and economic harm that comes when invading species travel between the Great Lakes and Mississippi River.</p>
	<p>Once established in the Great Lakes, the voracious filter-feeding, fast-growing carp could quickly dominate them; gobbling up the same food that sustains native fish populations and potentially devastating the region's $7 billion fishing industry.</p>
