	      <p>Release of the long-awaited federal Great Lakes and Mississippi River Interbasin Studypresents a major opportunity for the public to help jump-start progress on the critical issue of keeping Asian carp and other invasives out of the Great Lakes.</p>

	      <p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers report lays out, for the first time, the federal government’s options for keeping Asian carp and other invasive species out of the Great Lakes.</p>
	      <p>A major part of the report lays some of the groundwork for building a physical barrier that restores the natural Great Lakes-Mississippi River basin divide. With Asian carp edging ever closer to Lake Michigan via Chicago waterways, the corps needs to hear that further delays of a permanent solution to protect the Great Lakes are not acceptable.</p>

	      <p>The Alliance has been a leader in calling for restoration of this natural divide since 2003 and continues to work to protect the Great Lakes from the transfer of invasive species between the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins.</p>
